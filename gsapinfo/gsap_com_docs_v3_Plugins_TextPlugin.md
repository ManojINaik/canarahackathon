Quick Start

#### CDN link [​](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/TextPlugin/\#cdn-link "Direct link to CDN link")

copy

#### Register [​](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/TextPlugin/\#register "Direct link to Register")

```codeBlockLines_p187
 gsap.registerPlugin(TextPlugin)

```

#### Minimal usage [​](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/TextPlugin/\#minimal-usage "Direct link to Minimal usage")

```codeBlockLines_p187
//replaces yourElement's text with "This is the new text"
gsap.to(yourElement, {
  duration: 2,
  text: "This is the new text",
  ease: "none",
});

```

Replaces the text content of a DOM element one character at a time (or one word at a time if you set `delimiter: " "`). So when the tween is finished, the DOM element's text has been completely replaced. This also means that if you rewind or restart the tween, the text will be reverted.

Here is a simple example of replacing the text in yourElement:

```codeBlockLines_p187
//replaces yourElement's text with "This is the new text" over the course of 2 seconds
gsap.to(yourElement, {
  duration: 2,
  text: "This is the new text",
  ease: "none",
});

```

## **Config Object** [​](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/TextPlugin/\#config-object "Direct link to config-object")

For advanced usage, set `text` to an object (like `text:{...}`) with any of the following properties:

### Property

### Description

- #### delimiter [Direct link to delimiter](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/TextPlugin/\#delimiter)

The character that should be used to split the text up. The default is `""`, so each character is isolated but if you'd prefer to animate in word-by-word instead you can use the space character, like

```
//replaces word-by-word because the delimiter is " " (a space) gsap.to("#element", {     duration: 2,     text: {         value: "This is the new text",         delimiter: " "     },     ease: "none" });
```

.

- #### newClass [Direct link to newClass](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/TextPlugin/\#newClass)

A CSS class that should be applied to the new text via a `` tag. This makes it easy to have the new text differentiated visually from the old text, like maybe it should be red or bold or something - just create a class in your CSS and pass the name in here like

```
//wraps the old text in  and the new text in a gsap.to("#element", {     duration: 2,     text: {         value: "This is the new text",         newClass: "class2",         oldClass: "class1"     },     ease: "power2" });
```

- #### oldClass [Direct link to oldClass](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/TextPlugin/\#oldClass)

A CSS class that should be applied to the old text via a `` tag.

- #### padSpace [Direct link to padSpace](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/TextPlugin/\#padSpace)

If the new text is shorter than the old text, it can be useful to pad the trailing space with non-breaking space HTML characters so that the old text doesn't collapse. If that's the effect you want, set `padSpace: true` inside the text object.

- #### preserveSpaces [Direct link to preserveSpaces](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/TextPlugin/\#preserveSpaces)

If `true`, it will force TextPlugin to maintain extra spaces, swapping in ` ` to make them show up in HTML.

- #### rtl [Direct link to rtl](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/TextPlugin/\#rtl)

if `true`, the text will be introduced from right-to-left (reverse order). See a [demo here](https://codepen.io/GreenSock/pen/wvrpPqv?editors=0010)

- #### speed [Direct link to speed](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/TextPlugin/\#speed)

Automatically adjust the **duration** of the tween according to how many changes there are in the text; a value of `1` is relatively slow, and a value of `20` is very fast. Without this feature, you'd need to specify a duration for the tween and it might be difficult to guess what looks good (animating 10 characters over 2 seconds looks VERY different than animating 500 in the same amount of time). In other words, `speed` lets you think more in terms of "changes per unit of time". Technically the formula is "0.05 / speed \* text\_changes".

- #### type [Direct link to type](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/TextPlugin/\#type)

If you'd like to only animate the differences in the text (skipping all of the character positions that are identical between the start and end strings), set `type: "diff"` (new in GSAP 3.0.4). If, for example, the first 50 characters are the same it might look like the animation is delayed because it's going character-by-character from the start, so `type: "diff"` solves that by skipping all the identical parts.

- #### value [Direct link to value](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/TextPlugin/\#value)

The replacement text string, like `"This is the new text"` (**REQUIRED**)

Use the object syntax for special properties

If you use any of the special properties above, make sure you put them **inside their own object**, not inside the main vars object, like this:

```codeBlockLines_p187
//GOOD:
gsap.to(yourElement, {
  duration: 1,
  text: {
    value: "Your new text",
    newClass: "class2",
    delimiter: " ",
  },
});

//BAD:
gsap.to(yourElement, {
  duration: 1,
  text: "Your new text",
  newClass: "class2",
  delimiter: " ",
});

```

TextPlugin will recognize simple HTML nodes like `<br>` and honor them (new in GSAP 3.0.4).

## FAQs [​](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/TextPlugin/\#faqs "Direct link to FAQs")

#### How do I include TextPlugin in my project?

See the [installation page](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Installation) for all the options (CDN, NPM, download, etc.) where there's even an interactive helper that provides the necessary code. Easy peasy. Don't forget to [register TextPlugin](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/gsap.registerPlugin()) like this in your project:

```codeBlockLines_p187
gsap.registerPlugin(TextPlugin)

```

#### Is this included in the GSAP core?

No, you must load/import it separately

#### Is this only for Club GSAP members?

No, it's available to everyone for free! But [Club GSAP](https://gsap.com/pricing/) is pretty awesome...just sayin'.

#### It works fine during development, but suddenly stops working in the production build! What do I do?

Your build tool is probably dropping the plugin when [tree shaking](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Tree_shaking) and you forgot to [register TextPlugin](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/gsap.registerPlugin()) (which protects it from tree shaking). Just register the plugin like this:

```codeBlockLines_p187
gsap.registerPlugin(TextPlugin)

```

#### Is it bad to register a plugin multiple times?

No, it's perfectly fine. It doesn't help anything, nor does it hurt.
