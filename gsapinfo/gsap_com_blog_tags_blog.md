## ðŸ¤˜ GSAP has been acquired by Webflow to take their animation capabilities to the next level! [â€‹](https://gsap.com/blog/tags/blog/\#-gsap-has-been-acquired-by-webflow-to-take-their-animation-capabilities-to-the-next-level "Direct link to ðŸ¤˜ GSAP has been acquired by Webflow to take their animation capabilities to the next level!")

This is exciting news for the future of GSAP â€” **for everyone**, but we know that the Webflow folks in particular will be over the moon! It's been a joy to watch our communities grow closer over the last few years â€” hyping each other up, learning together and producing some of our [all-time favourite showcase sites.](https://gsap.com/showcase/?page=1&tags=Webflow)

Of course our animation community extends far beyond Webflow. GSAP's flexibility and rich feature set make it extremely popular across all kinds of ecosystems, tools and frameworks. It powers over 12 million websites (including most award-winning ones). This acquisition puts GSAP in an even stronger position to serve the broader web community because Webflow is investing development resources into GSAP's continued product innovation.

**GSAP will continue to be publicly available for everyone to use on the wider web.** Both Webflow and the GSAP team are committed to maintaining and evolving the library, including for use outside of Webflow. We love this community and itâ€™s important to us that GSAP continues to be the go-to toolset for web animators everywhere.

If you pay for GSAP, we are honoring your current pricing plan and licensing â€“ so just business as usual!

## What is Webflow? Why the acquisition? [â€‹](https://gsap.com/blog/tags/blog/\#what-is-webflow-why-the-acquisition "Direct link to What is Webflow? Why the acquisition?")

Webflow is a Website Experience Platform (WXP) with a mission to bring development superpowers to everyone - whether a designer, marketer, developer, or agency. Webflow empowers marketing and engineering teams to visually build, manage, and optimize stunning websites. Go on, [take a look](https://webflow.com/). Their homepage is even animated with GSAP. ðŸ’š

![](https://gsap.com/img/logos/old-logo.gif) Anyone that's been using GSAP for a while will know that bringing 'superpowers' to everyone is precisely what we aim to do. Webflow and GSAP have the same heart, taking the complicated and making it simple, helping everyone bring their ideas to life, even people who are just starting with code.

Until now, creating a GSAP GUI was an _impossible pipe dream_ for our small team (despite all the requests for it) but with Webflow's expertise and resources - we're in good hands. The Webflow team has a knack for creating clean easy-to-use interfaces, and we're incredibly excited about combining our expertise to bring something beautiful to life. In short, we're better together.

We don't know exactly what this will look like yet... but we know it's going to be special.

We'd love to hear from you about what your hopes are as GSAP joins the Webflow family. What are your ideas? Help us shape the future. [We're listening.](https://gsap.com/community/forums/topic/42693-gsap-is-joining-webflow/)

## [The "Why" Behind the GreenSock License](https://gsap.com/blog/why-license)

February 1, 2016 Â· 11 min read

Have you ever wondered why GreenSock doesn't use a more common open source license like MIT? Sometimes our licensing model is misunderstood but hopefully after reading this article you'll see why it is so foundational to the success of our tools and why it ultimately benefits users too.

## [What's so special about GSAP?](https://gsap.com/blog/why-gsap)

January 17, 2014 Â· 19 min read

info

Feature lists don't always tell the story in a way that's relevant to you as the developer/designer in the trenches, trying to get **real work done** for **real clients**. You hear about theoretical benefits of CSS animations or some fancy new library that claims to solve various challenges, but then you discover things fall apart when you actually try to use it or the API is exceedingly cumbersome. You need things to **just work**.
