# Easing

Extra and Club Eases

["slow"](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Eases/SlowMo), ["rough"](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Eases/RoughEase), and ["expoScale"](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Eases/ExpoScaleEase) eases are not in the core - they are packaged together in an **EasePack** file in order to minimize file size. ["CustomEase"](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Eases/CustomEase), ["CustomBounce"](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Eases/CustomBounce), and ["CustomWiggle"](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Eases/CustomWiggle) are packaged independently as well (not in the core).

See the [installation page](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Installation) for details.

**Easing is the primary way to change the timing of your tweens.** Simply changing the ease can adjust the entire feel and personality of your animation. There are infinite eases that you can use in GSAP so we created the visualizer below to help you choose exactly the type of easing that you need.

Coding tip - Default Easing

GSAP uses a default ease of `"power1.out"`. You can overwrite this in any tween by setting the `ease` property of that tween to another (valid) ease value. You can set a different default ease for GSAP by using [gsap.defaults()](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/gsap.defaults()). You can also set defaults for particular [timelines](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/Timeline).

```codeBlockLines_p187
gsap.defaults({
  ease: "power2.in",
  duration: 1,
});

gsap.timeline({defaults: {ease: "power2.in"}})

```

## How to use the Ease Visualizer [​](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Eases/\#how-to-use-the-ease-visualizer "Direct link to How to use the Ease Visualizer")

To use the ease visualizer, simply click on the ease name that you'd like to use. You can also click on the underlined text to change the values and type of ease.
