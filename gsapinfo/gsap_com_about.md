# About

### Here since ActionScript - Still innovating

## There is a special breed of developer/designer with a passion for building experiences, not just static interfaces.

They won't settle for rollovers and a few fadeins/fadeouts. They sweat the details. For them, success isn’t measured by "does it work?" but rather "is it a joy to use?"

They're students of their craft, pushing the limits and chasing excellence. They’re rarely satisfied with their own work, but that's what makes them good. The screen is their playground.

That special breed is precisely who we aim to serve. Having been in the trenches for over 15 years, we understand the unique challenges that developers face.

One of the most common frustrations is the lack of reliable, well-crafted, and robust code that could be consistently used across projects. Sure, there were open source options and code snippets but most of them were either abandoned, inefficient, anemic, obtuse, bloated, or riddled with bugs. The commercial components we saw were largely built for novices, lacking professional-grade flexibility or performance. So we set about the task of crafting the tools we craved. When we shared them with the community, the response was nothing short of astounding.

We’re obsessed with making the tools better and we're committed to supporting the [community](https://gsap.com/community) that has grown to love our tools almost as much as we do.

### Our Team

### Jack Doyle


Founder and Code Connoisseur



An odd mix of designer and developer, Jack transitioned from an award-winning artist into a code-obsessed
geek
who crafted the GreenSock tools. He is the world’s worst multi-tasker (he can barely walk and chew gum at the
same time), but if you give him a challenge or riddle, his one-track (ahem, stubborn) mind locks in and won’t
let go until it is solved. He gets a kick out of dreaming up ways to accomplish various advanced feats with
JavaScript/HTML/CSS and then delivering tools that make it easy for others.



Listen to Jack interviewed on the [Eggheadio podcast here](https://egghead.io/podcasts/jack-doyle-creator-of-greensock).



Jack lives near Chicago with his 2 sons. He played volleyball for Illinois State
University and still enjoys playing despite his aging joints and declining vertical leap. He loves discussing
the issues related to what people believe (and why), who Jesus is (or isn’t), and how faith affects our lives
in practical ways.


He shared a little bit about his [faith journey here.](https://gsap.com/community/faith/)

### Cassie Evans


Lead Bestower of Animation Superpowers



Cassie is an international speaker and creative developer with a background in graphic design and motion
design. She has written for [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) and [Codrops](https://tympanus.net/codrops/) and has thrown workshops for [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/).



When learning to code she was blown away by how supportive the web community was and loves nothing more than
giving back and passing this knowledge on to new developers. Her favourite motto for teaching others is
"assume
zero experience but infinite intelligence".



She loves creating and encouraging spaces for people to share, learn and bounce ideas off each other. At
GreenSock, she does everything from teaching and speaking to improving greensock.com and answering questions
in
the [forums](https://gsap.com/community).



When she's not tinkering on the web, she's off having adventures in the English countryside with her best
pal
Brody - the most wonderful dog in the world.

### Rodrigo Hernando


Senior Developer



Rodrigo is a Chemical Engineer turned front end developer after learning it all on his own. He began working
with GSAP back in the Flash days, then switched to React and Vue apps/ecosystems with some Vanilla JavaScript
mixed in. GSAP has been a passion of his for years, of course.



He lives outside Santiago (Chile) in the Maipo Canyon, at the base of The Andes with his Girlfriend and
their
four dogs. When he's not in front of his computer crafting clever code and helping people in the [forums](https://gsap.com/community), he likes spending time outside, gardening, bird watching,
gazing at the beautiful mountains, having long conversations with his Girlfriend, enjoying time with his dogs
and watching sports.
