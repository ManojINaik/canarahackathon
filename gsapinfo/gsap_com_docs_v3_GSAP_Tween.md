# Tween

A Tween is what does all the animation work - think of it like a **high-performance property setter**. You feed in targets (the objects you want to animate), a duration, and any properties you want to animate and when its playhead moves to a new position, it figures out what the property values should be at that point applies them accordingly.

**Methods for creating a Tween** (all of these methods return a Tween instance):

- [gsap.to()](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/gsap.to())
- [gsap.from()](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/gsap.from())
- [gsap.fromTo()](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/gsap.fromTo())

For simple animations, the methods above are all you need! For example:

```codeBlockLines_p187
//rotate and move elements with a class of "box" ("x" is a shortcut for a translateX() transform) over the course of 1 second.
gsap.to(".box", { rotation: 27, x: 100, duration: 1 });

```

Since GSAP can animate any property of any object, you are NOT limited to CSS properties or DOM objects. Go crazy. You may be surprised by how many things can be animated with GSAP and it "just works".

You can do basic sequencing by using the `delay` special property, but [Timelines](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/Timeline) make sequencing and complex choreography much, much easier. A Timeline is like a container for multiple Tween instances (and/or other [Timelines](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/Timeline)) where you can position them in time and control them as a whole. See the [Timeline docs](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/Timeline) for details.

To control the Tween instance later, assign it to a variable (GSAP is conveniently object-oriented):

```codeBlockLines_p187
let tween = gsap.to(".class", { rotation: 360, duration: 5, ease: "elastic" });

//now we can control it!
tween.pause();
tween.seek(2);
tween.progress(0.5);
tween.play();

```

info

To simply fire off animations and let them run, there's no need to use variables. Tweens play immediately by default (though you can set a `delay` or `paused` value) and when they finish, they automatically dispose of themselves. Call `gsap.to()` as much as you want without worrying about cleanup.

Parameters

1. **targets** \- the object(s) whose properties you want to animate. This can be selector text like `".class"`, `"#id"`, etc. (GSAP uses [`document.querySelectorAll()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelectorAll) internally) or it can be direct references to elements,  generic objects, or even an array of objects
2. **vars** \- an object containing all the properties/values you want to animate, along with any special properties like `ease`, `duration`, `delay`, or `onComplete` (listed below).

## Special Properties [​](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/Tween/\#special-properties "Direct link to Special Properties")

### Property

### Description

- #### callbackScope [Direct link to callbackScope](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/Tween/\#callbackScope)

The scope to be used for all of the callbacks (onStart, onUpdate, onComplete, etc.).

- #### data [Direct link to data](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/Tween/\#data)

Assign arbitrary data to this property (a string, a reference to an object, whatever) and it gets attached to the tween instance itself so that you can reference it later like `yourTween.data`.

- #### delay [Direct link to delay](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/Tween/\#delay)

Amount of delay before the animation should begin (in seconds).

- #### duration [Direct link to duration](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/Tween/\#duration)

The duration of the animation (in seconds). Default: `0.5`.

- #### ease [Direct link to ease](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/Tween/\#ease)

Controls the rate of change during the animation, giving it a specific feel. For example, `"elastic"` or `"strong.inOut"`. See the [Ease Visualizer](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Eases) for a list of all of the options. `ease` can be a String (most common) or a function that accepts a progress value between 0 and 1 and returns a converted, similarly normalized value. Default: `"power1.out"`.

- #### id [Direct link to id](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/Tween/\#id)

Allows you to (optionally) assign a unique identifier to your tween instance so that you can find it later with `gsap.getById()` and it will show up in [GSDevTools](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/GSDevTools/) with that id.

- #### immediateRender [Direct link to immediateRender](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/Tween/\#immediateRender)

Normally a tween waits to render for the first time until the very next tick (update cycle) unless you specify a delay. Set `immediateRender: true` to force it to render immediately upon instantiation. Default: `false` for [to()](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/gsap.to()) tweens, `true` for [from()](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/gsap.from()) and [fromTo()](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/gsap.fromTo()) tweens or anything with a [scrollTrigger](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/ScrollTrigger) applied.

- #### inherit [Direct link to inherit](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/Tween/\#inherit)

Normally tweens inherit from their parent timeline's `defaults` object (if one is defined), but you can disable this on a per-tween basis by setting `inherit: false`.

- #### lazy [Direct link to lazy](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/Tween/\#lazy)

When a tween renders for the very first time and reads its starting values, GSAP will try to delay writing of values until the very end of the current "tick" which can improve performance because it avoids the read/write/read/write layout thrashing that browsers dislike. To disable lazy rendering for a particular tween, set `lazy: false`. In most cases, there's no need to set `lazy`. To learn more, watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMHJptqnDpU). Default: `true` (except for zero-duration tweens).

- #### onComplete [Direct link to onComplete](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/Tween/\#onComplete)

A function to call when the animation has completed.

- #### onCompleteParams [Direct link to onCompleteParams](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/Tween/\#onCompleteParams)

An Array of parameters to pass the onComplete function. For example, `gsap.to(".class", {x:100, onComplete:myFunction, onCompleteParams:["param1", "param2"]});`.

- #### onRepeat [Direct link to onRepeat](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/Tween/\#onRepeat)

A function to call each time the animation enters a new iteration cycle (repeats). Obviously this only occurs if you set a non-zero `repeat`.

- #### onRepeatParams [Direct link to onRepeatParams](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/Tween/\#onRepeatParams)

An Array of parameters to pass the onRepeat function.

- #### onReverseComplete [Direct link to onReverseComplete](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/Tween/\#onReverseComplete)

A function to call when the animation has reached its beginning again from the reverse direction (excluding repeats).

- #### onReverseCompleteParams [Direct link to onReverseCompleteParams](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/Tween/\#onReverseCompleteParams)

An Array of parameters to pass the onReverseComplete function.

- #### onStart [Direct link to onStart](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/Tween/\#onStart)

A function to call when the animation begins (when its time changes from 0 to some other value which can happen more than once if the tween is restarted multiple times).

- #### onStartParams [Direct link to onStartParams](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/Tween/\#onStartParams)

An Array of parameters to pass the onStart function.

- #### onUpdate [Direct link to onUpdate](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/Tween/\#onUpdate)

A function to call every time the animation updates (on each "tick" that moves its playhead).

- #### onUpdateParams [Direct link to onUpdateParams](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/Tween/\#onUpdateParams)

An Array of parameters to pass the onUpdate function.

- #### overwrite [Direct link to overwrite](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/Tween/\#overwrite)

If `true`, all tweens of the same targets will be killed immediately regardless of what properties they affect. If `"auto"`, when the tween renders for the first time it hunt down any conflicts in active animations (animating the same properties of the same targets) and kill **only those parts** of the other tweens. Non-conflicting parts remain intact. If `false`, no overwriting strategies will be employed. Default: `false`.

- #### paused [Direct link to paused](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/Tween/\#paused)

If `true`, the animation will pause itself immediately upon creation. Default: `false`.

- #### repeat [Direct link to repeat](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/Tween/\#repeat)

How many times the animation should repeat. So `repeat: 1` would play a total of two iterations. Default: `0`.
`repeat: -1` will repeat infinitely.

- #### repeatDelay [Direct link to repeatDelay](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/Tween/\#repeatDelay)

Amount of time to wait between repeats (in seconds). Default: `0`.

- #### repeatRefresh [Direct link to repeatRefresh](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/Tween/\#repeatRefresh)

Setting `repeatRefresh: true` causes a repeating tween to `invalidate()` and re-record its starting/ending values internally on each full iteration (not including yoyo's). This is useful when you use dynamic values (relative, random, or function-based). For example, `x: "random(-100, 100)"` would get a new random x value on each repeat. `duration`, `delay`, and `stagger` do **NOT** refresh.

- #### reversed [Direct link to reversed](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/Tween/\#reversed)

If `true`, the animation will start out with its playhead reversed, meaning it will be oriented to move toward its start. Since the playhead begins at a time of 0 anyway, a reversed tween will _appear_ paused initially because its playhead cannot move backward past the start.

- #### runBackwards [Direct link to runBackwards](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/Tween/\#runBackwards)

If `true`, the animation will invert its starting and ending values (this is what a [from()](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/gsap.from()) tween does internally), though the ease doesn't get flipped. In other words, you can make a `to()` tween into a `from()` by setting `runBackwards: true`.

- #### stagger [Direct link to stagger](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/Tween/\#stagger)

If multiple targets are defined, you can easily [stagger](https://codepen.io/GreenSock/pen/938f5cd34818443c43af9ba2692137a5) the start times for each by setting a value like `stagger: 0.1` (for 0.1 seconds between each start time). Or you can get much more advanced staggers by using a stagger object. For more information, see [the stagger documentation](https://gsap.com/resources/getting-started/Staggers).

- #### startAt [Direct link to startAt](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/Tween/\#startAt)

Defines starting values for any properties (even if they're not animating). For example, `startAt: {x: -100, opacity: 0}`

- #### yoyo [Direct link to yoyo](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/Tween/\#yoyo)

If `true`, every other `repeat` iteration will run in the opposite direction so that the tween appears to go back and forth. This has no affect on the `reversed` property though. So if `repeat` is `2` and `yoyo` is `false`, it will look like: start - 1 - 2 - 3 - 1 - 2 - 3 - 1 - 2 - 3 - end. But if `yoyo` is `true`, it will look like: start - 1 - 2 - 3 - 3 - 2 - 1 - 1 - 2 - 3 - end. Default: `false`.

- #### yoyoEase [Direct link to yoyoEase](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/Tween/\#yoyoEase)

Allows you to alter the ease in the tween's `yoyo` phase. Set it to a specific ease like `"power2.in"` or set it to `true` to simply invert the tween's normal `ease`. Note: GSAP is smart enough to automatically set `yoyo: true` if you define any `yoyoEase`, so there's less code for you to write. Default: `false`.

- #### keyframes [Direct link to keyframes](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/Tween/\#keyframes)

To animate the targets to various states, use `keyframes` \- an array of vars objects that serve as `to()` tweens. For example, `keyframes: [{x:100, duration:1}, {y:100, duration:0.5}]`. All keyframes will be perfectly sequenced back-to-back, but you can define a `delay` value to add spacing between each step (or a negative delay would create an overlap). Keyframes are only to be used in `to()` tweens.

## Plugins [​](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/Tween/\#plugins "Direct link to Plugins")

A plugin adds extra capabilities to GSAP's core. Some plugins make it easier to work with rendering libraries like PIXI.js or EaselJS while other plugins add superpowers like [morphing](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/MorphSVGPlugin) SVG shapes, adding [drag and drop](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/Draggable) functionality, etc. This allows the GSAP core to remain relatively small and lets you add features only when you need them. [See the full list of plugins here](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins).

## Function-based values [​](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/Tween/\#function-based-values "Direct link to Function-based values")

Get incredibly dynamic animations by using a function for any value, and it will get called **once for each target** the first time the tween renders, and whatever is returned by that function will be used as the value. This can be very useful for applying conditional logic or randomizing things (though GSAP has baked-in randomizing capabilities too...scroll down for that).

```codeBlockLines_p187
gsap.to(".class", {
    x: 100, //normal value
    y: function(index, target, targets) { //function-based value
        return index \* 50;
    },
    duration: 1
});

```

The function is passed three parameters:

1. index - the index of the target in the array. For example, if there are 3 `<div>` elements with the class ".box", and you `gsap.to(".box", ...)`, the function gets called 3 times (once for each target); the index would be `0` first, then `1`, and finally `2`.
2. target - the target itself (the `<div>` element in this example)
3. targets - the array of targets (same as `tween.targets()`)

## Random values [​](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/Tween/\#random-values "Direct link to Random values")

Define random values as a string like `"random(-100, 100)"` for a range or like `"random([red, blue, green])"` for an array and GSAP will swap in a random value **for each target** accordingly! This makes advanced randomized effects simple. You can even have the random number rounded to the closest increment of any number! For example:

```codeBlockLines_p187
gsap.to(".class", {
x:"random(-100, 100, 5)" //chooses a random number between -100 and 100 for each target, rounding to the closest 5!
});

```

Or use an array-like value and GSAP will randomly select one of those:

```codeBlockLines_p187
gsap.to(".class", {
x:"random(\[0, 100, 200, 500\])" //randomly selects one of the values (0, 100, 200, or 500)
});

```

There's also a [`gsap.utils.random()`](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/UtilityMethods/random()) function that you can use directly if you prefer.

## Relative values [​](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/Tween/\#relative-values "Direct link to Relative values")

Use a `"+="` or `"-="` prefix to indicate a relative value. For example, `gsap.to(".class", {x:"-=20"});` will animate `x` 20 pixels **less than** whatever it is when the tween starts. `{x:"+=20"}` would **add** 20.

## Staggers [​](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/Tween/\#staggers "Direct link to Staggers")

If multiple targets are defined, you can easily [stagger](https://codepen.io/GreenSock/pen/938f5cd34818443c43af9ba2692137a5) (offset) the start times for each by setting a value like `stagger: 0.1` (for 0.1 seconds between each start time). Or you can get much more advanced staggers by using a stagger object. For more information, see [the stagger documentation](https://gsap.com/resources/getting-started/Staggers).

## Sequencing [​](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/Tween/\#sequencing "Direct link to Sequencing")

For basic sequencing, you could use a `delay` on each tween (like ``gsap.to(".class", {`delay: 0.5,` duration: 1, x: 100})``), but we **strongly** recommended using a [`Timeline`](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/Timeline) for all but the simplest sequencing tasks because it gives you much greater flexibility, especially when you're experimenting with timing. It allows you to append tweens one-after-the-other and then control the entire sequence as a whole. You can even have the tweens overlap as much as you want,  nest timelines as deeply as you want, and much, much more.

Timelines have convenient [to()](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/Timeline/to()), [from()](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/Timeline/from()), and [fromTo()](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/Timeline/fromTo()) methods as well so you can very easily chain them together and build complex sequences:

```codeBlockLines_p187
let tl = gsap.timeline(); //create the timeline
tl.to(".class1", {x: 100}) //start sequencing
.to(".class2", {y: 100, ease: "elastic"})
.to(".class3", {rotation: 180});

```

## Keyframes [​](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/Tween/\#keyframes "Direct link to Keyframes")

If you find yourself animating the same target over and over again, you should definitely check out [Keyframes](https://gsap.com/resources/keyframes/) which can make your code much more concise. They also let you port animations over from CSS animations easily.

## Notes / Tips [​](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/Tween/\#notes--tips "Direct link to Notes / Tips")

- You can change the default ease via [`gsap.defaults({ease: ...})`](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/gsap.defaults()). The default is `"power1.out"`.
- Kill all tweens of a particular object anytime with [`gsap.killTweensOf(yourObject)`](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/gsap.killTweensOf()) You can also use selector text like `gsap.killTweensOf("#someID");`
- You can kill all `delayedCall` s to a particular function with [`gsap.killTweensOf(myFunction)`](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/gsap.killTweensOf())
