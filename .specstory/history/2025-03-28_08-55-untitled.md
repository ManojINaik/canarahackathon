DevDiscuss Reputation & Bounties:

Concept: Gamify the /dev-discuss section. Award reputation points for upvoted questions/answers and accepted solutions. Display reputation on user profiles. Allow users to post questions with a point "bounty" attached, which is awarded to the accepted answer.

Integration: Enhances /dev-discuss, questionModel, userModel (for reputation points). Updates needed for voting/answer acceptance logic.

I'll help you implement the DevDiscuss Reputation & Bounties feature. Let's first examine the project structure to understand how to integrate this.

Let's look at the app directory since the user mentioned integration with models and the dev-discuss section:

Now I need to look at the userModel.js and questionModel.js to understand their structure:

Let's also look at the dev-discuss page to understand how questions are displayed:

Now, let's check the API endpoints for upvoting and replying to questions:

Now let's check the API endpoint for downvoting a question:

Read file: undefined

Finally, let's check the reply API endpoint:

Read file: undefined

Now that I have a good understanding of the codebase, I'll implement the DevDiscuss Reputation & Bounties feature. Here's my plan:

1. Update the userModel.js to include reputation points and a history of bounties
2. Update the questionModel.js to include bounty information
3. Modify the upvote/downvote and reply routes to award reputation points
4. Create a new route for marking answers as accepted
5. Update the UI components to display reputation and bounties

Let's start with updating the models:
