Based on your .env file and question, I can provide guidance on the database choice:

You can use either MongoDB or Supabase for your project - there's no strict requirement to stick with MongoDB just because it's in the .env file. Both are excellent choices with different strengths:

MongoDB:
- Already configured in your .env (though needs a proper URI)
- Great for flexible document-based data structures
- Excellent for scalability and handling unstructured data
- Strong integration with Next.js through packages like mongoose

Supabase:
- Provides additional features like authentication, real-time subscriptions
- SQL-based (PostgreSQL) if you prefer relational databases
- Has a generous free tier
- Great developer experience with their client libraries

The choice depends on your specific needs:
1. If you need relational data structures → Supabase might be better
2. If you need flexible document storage → MongoDB might be better
3. If you want built-in real-time features → Supabase has this out of the box
4. If you're more comfortable with SQL → Supabase
5. If you prefer NoSQL → MongoDB

You can even use both if your project requires it, though I'd recommend starting with one to keep things simple.

If you decide to switch to Supabase, you'll need to:
1. Remove the MONGODB_URI from your .env
2. Add Supabase credentials (URL and anon key)
3. Update your database connection logic

Would you like me to provide example configuration code for either option?
