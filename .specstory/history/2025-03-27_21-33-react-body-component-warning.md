Let me take a look at this error message. The issue is that you have multiple `<body>` components being mounted simultaneously, which causes unpredictable behavior in React.

I found the issue! You have multiple components trying to render `<html>` and `<body>` tags:

1. In `app/layout.js` you have a `RootLayout` component that renders:
```jsx
<html lang="en">
  <body>{children}</body>
</html>
```

2. In `app/dev-discuss/layout.js` you have another component also named `RootLayout` with the same structure:
```jsx
<html lang="en">
  <body>{children}</body>
</html>
```

In Next.js, you should only have one root layout that defines the `<html>` and `<body>` tags. Nested layouts shouldn't redefine these elements.

Let me fix the `dev-discuss/layout.js` file:

---

_****_

```diff
  export const metadata = {
-   title: 'Next.js',
-   description: 'Generated by Next.js',
+   title: 'Dev Discuss',
+   description: 'Developer discussion forum',
  }
  
- export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
-   return (
-     <html lang="en">
-       <body>{children}</body>
-     </html>
-   )
+ export default function DevDiscussLayout({ children }) {
+   return children;
  }
  
```

---

_****_

The error should be fixed now. I've made the following changes:

1. Removed the duplicate `<html>` and `<body>` tags from `app/dev-discuss/layout.js`
2. Renamed the component from `RootLayout` to `DevDiscussLayout` to better reflect its purpose
3. Updated the metadata to be specific to the Dev Discuss section

In Next.js, you should only have one root layout (typically in `app/layout.js`) that defines the document structure with `<html>` and `<body>` tags. Nested layouts should only wrap their children with additional structure as needed, but never redefine these fundamental HTML elements.

I see a MongoDB connection issue in your application. The error indicates that your IP address isn't whitelisted in MongoDB Atlas:

```
MongoDB connection error: MongooseServerSelectionError: Could not connect to any servers in your MongoDB Atlas cluster. One common reason is that you're trying to access the database from an IP that isn't whitelisted.
```

To fix this:

1. Log in to your MongoDB Atlas account at https://cloud.mongodb.com
2. Select your cluster (canara)
3. Go to Network Access in the left sidebar
4. Click "Add IP Address"
5. Add your current IP or use "Allow Access from Anywhere" (0.0.0.0/0) for development
6. Click "Confirm"

After whitelisting your IP, restart your application and the MongoDB connection should work.

I see several issues in your logs:

1. The main error is related to passing MongoDB objects directly to client components:
```
Warning: Only plain objects can be passed to Client Components from Server Components. Objects with toJSON methods are not supported.
  {userId: ..., vote: 1, _id: {buffer: ...}}
```

Let's fix the MongoDB serialization issue in your question data handlers:

Based on the files I've reviewed, I see the issue. Let's fix the MongoDB object serialization problem by updating the route handlers and the question action file:

---

_****_

```diff
      // Format dates and IDs for client-friendly response
      question._id = question._id.toString();
+     
+     // Fix serialization issue - properly convert MongoDB objects to plain objects
+     if (question.voters && question.voters.length > 0) {
+       question.voters = question.voters.map(voter => ({
+         userId: voter.userId,
+         vote: voter.vote,
+         _id: voter._id.toString()
+       }));
+     }
+     
      question.replies = question.replies.map((reply) => ({
        ...reply,
-       createdAt: reply.createdAt.toISOString(),
+       _id: reply._id ? reply._id.toString() : undefined,
+       createdAt: reply.createdAt ? reply.createdAt.toISOString() : new Date().toISOString(),
      }));
  
```

Now let's update the upvote route handler to properly handle the MongoDB objects:
